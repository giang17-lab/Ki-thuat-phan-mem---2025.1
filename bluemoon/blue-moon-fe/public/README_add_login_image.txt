Place the image you attached (the moon image) here and name it exactly: login-image.jpg

Path: public/login-image.jpg

Example (PowerShell):

Copy-Item -Path "C:\path\to\your\downloaded\image.jpg" -Destination "d:\Downloads\bluemoon\blue-moon-fe\public\login-image.jpg"

After placing the image, refresh the browser to see the new login background. If the dev server was restarted, the change should appear automatically.
